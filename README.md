# DanSocialMedia

DanSocialMedia is a modern social media web application built with React and Vite. It features modular components, fast development with Vite, and a clean, responsive design. The project includes user authentication, post creation, and integration with Firebase for backend services but still it is not done.

Key technologies used:
- React for building user interfaces
- Vite for fast development and hot module replacement
- Firebase for authentication and data storage

Explore the code to see how these technologies are combined to create a functional social media platform.
